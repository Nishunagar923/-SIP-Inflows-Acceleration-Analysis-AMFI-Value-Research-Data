# -SIP-Inflows-Acceleration-Analysis-AMFI-Value-Research-Data
Analysis of SIP inflow acceleration in India using AMFI and Value Research data with SQL, ETL, and visualization.

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the rapid acceleration in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows in India.  
Using historical data from **AMFI** and the **Value Research** database, I performed data extraction, cleaning, and analysis to understand how quickly monthly SIP inflows are growing over time.

The final output highlights that adding ₹4,000 crore to monthly SIP inflows now takes a fraction of the time compared to just a few years ago.
