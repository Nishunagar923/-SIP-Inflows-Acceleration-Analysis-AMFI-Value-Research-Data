# -SIP-Inflows-Acceleration-Analysis-AMFI-Value-Research-Data
Analysis of SIP inflow acceleration in India using AMFI and Value Research data with SQL, ETL, and visualization.

## Overview
This project explores the rapid acceleration in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows in India.  
Using historical data from **AMFI** and the **Value Research** database, I performed data extraction, cleaning, and analysis to understand how quickly monthly SIP inflows are growing over time.

The final output highlights that adding ₹4,000 crore to monthly SIP inflows now takes a fraction of the time compared to just a few years ago.

## Key Findings
- Time to add ₹4,000 crore in monthly SIP inflows:
  - **2016–2018:** ~23 months
  - **2018–2021:** ~44 months
  - **2021–2023:** ~20 months
  - **2023–2024:** ~7 months
  - **2024–2025:** ~5 months  
- This showcases **exponential retail investor participation** in mutual funds.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL** – Extracted SIP inflow data from AMFI & Value Research databases
- **Excel / Pandas** – Data cleaning, ETL operations, and trend calculations
- **Data Visualization** – Custom graph showing time compression in SIP inflow growth
